  The challenge was to the best of my current ability, using Flexbox, to recreate the website Nvidia.com/geforce! I recently had done a very much needed upgrade to my computer, and wanted to show my capabilities using this site!

## How Its Made

**Languages used:** Html and CSS

### Html
With the html, I worked with more lists and links. I did not go with `button element`, but styled and customized the buttons. Organized and neat, I prefer to keep my Html this way. Personally, I need to work on class and id names for specificity. 

### CSS
For this project, I went with `Flexbox` and learned a lot. It was fun to use and it gave me the required styling without having to add more lines of code. I made 2 separate CSS files to hold my style and the 2nd to hold my effects. 

## Styling Effects

I added styling and effects for the navigation bar, buttons and the link icons. I added the GeForce Font style to make the site look like its original.

# What I Learned
### Flexbox 

A very educating experience while being easier and more fun to use! I learned a lot when it came to containers and how they work in flex. I did not get to use as many flex methods as I would have liked. But finding out why somethings worked and why others didn't, helped shape my knowledge and the idea of how flexbox works. Definitely a layout model to skill in and master.
