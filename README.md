  The challenge was to the best of my current ability, using Flexbox, to recreate the website Nvidia.com/geforce! I recently had done a very much needed upgrade to my computer, and wanted to show my capabilities using this site!

## How Its Made

**Languages used:** Html and CSS

### Html
With the html, I worked with more lists and links. I did not go with `button element`, but styled and customized the buttons. Organized and neat, I prefer to keep my Html this way. Personally, I need to work on class and id names for specificity. 

### CSS
For this project, I went with `Flexbox` and learned a lot. It was fun to use and it gave me the required styling without having to add more lines of code. I made 2 separate CSS files to hold my style and the 2nd to hold my effects. 

## Styling Effects

I added styling and effects for the navigation bar, buttons and the link icons. I added the GeForce Font style to make the site look like its original.

# What I Learned
### Flexbox 

A very educating experience while being easier and more fun to use! I learned a lot when it came to containers and how they work in flex. I did not get to use as many flex methods as I would have liked. But finding out why somethings worked and why others didn't, helped shape my knowledge and the idea of how flexbox works. Definitely a layout model to skill in and master.

### Transitions

Learned about transitions and its different applications. I wanted to apply one of the websites transitioning effects and through that, I learned about property, delay, timing-function and much more! Im excited to continue learning about these properties and how to use them to my full benefits!

### Select Menu
Learned about select menus and options. I learned how to style them and create custom select menus. 

### Appearance
Learned about the appearance property and its different options based on the browser. When it comes to changing or styling specific elements, this property is the way to achieve that.
